The mission of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) [Office of Rural Health](http://www.ruralhealth.va.gov/)
(ORH) is to improve access and quality of care for rural Veterans by developing
evidence-based policies and innovative practices that support the unique needs
of enrolled Veterans residing in geographically remote areas.

The purpose of the VHA ORH Care-Share Pilot is to explore methods to improve
home healthcare coordination for rural Veterans by providing communication and
information sharing of care plans in a web-based environment.
